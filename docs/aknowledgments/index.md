The smellscape-representation methods implemented in the plotting functions of SmellscaPy are derived and adapted from the probabilistic soundscape framework described in the publication by Andrew Mitchell et al.

We gratefully acknowledge the authors of Soundscapy for their conceptual and methodological foundation, which significantly informed the development of the smellscape visualisation tools in this project.
