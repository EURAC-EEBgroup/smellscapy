**SmellscaPy** is a Python library for analysing and representing **indoor smellscape perceptual data**.  
It provides tools for **data validation, calculation of perceptual indices, and visualization** to support reproducible research in sensory and environmental studies.

## **Key Features**

- **Data validation & preprocessing** of smellscape survey datasets  
- **Computation of perceptual indicators** (i.e., pleasantness, presence)  
- **Visualizations**: scatter plots, density plots, simplified density plots  
- **Integration with the Python scientific stack** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- **Ready-to-use example datasets** for tutorials and testing   


## **Installation**

SmellscaPy can be installed with pip:

```bash
pip install smellscapy
```
Requires **Python 3.12.9+**.

## **Documentation**
This [documentation](overview/index.md) is designed to help you understand and use SmellscaPy effectively.
